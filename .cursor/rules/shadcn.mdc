# shadcn/ui Instructions

## Install / Update Components

- Use the latest shadcn CLI.
- Always install components via CLI (do not hand-copy from docs unless required).
- Command example (preferred):

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add button
```

- When adding multiple components, add them explicitly:

```bash
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add dialog dropdown-menu tooltip
```

- If a component requires another (e.g. Dialog + Button), install both and keep the generated structure.

## Project Conventions

- Keep shadcn-generated components in `src/components/ui/*` (or the configured ui directory).
- Do not rename files, exports, or internal structure without a clear reason.
- Do not add wrappers around shadcn components unless they introduce real behavior or enforce business rules.
- Do not restate common style guides — rely on linting and existing patterns in the codebase.

## Styling Rules

- Use Tailwind classes only (no inline styles).
- Extend styles via:

  - `className`
  - `variant` / `size`
  - new `cva` variants when truly needed
- Do not hardcode design colors if tokens exist.

  - Prefer theme tokens (`bg-background`, `text-foreground`, etc.).
- Use `cn()` for class composition only (import from the project’s utils path).

## Variants (cva)

- Use `class-variance-authority` for variants and sizes.
- Keep variants simple and predictable (`variant`, `size`).
- Add variants only when reused in multiple places.
- Always keep typings in sync when variants change.

## Composition Rules

- Follow standard shadcn/Radix composition patterns.
- Do not flatten or merge primitives unless behavior and types are fully preserved.

## Avoid

- Duplicating shadcn components under new names.
- Creating generic “Base*” components without enforcing constraints.
- Removing `cn`, `cva`, or Radix primitives to “simplify”.
- Documenting obvious tools or rare edge cases.
- Copying code that already exists — reference canonical examples instead.

## Output Expectations

- Prefer existing ui components.
- Add new components only when necessary.
- Keep changes minimal, consistent, and aligned with shadcn conventions.
